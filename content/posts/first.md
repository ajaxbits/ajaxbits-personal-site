This is the blog I've made. 

Trying to be truly authentic with how this is presented and the content that's in it. Which is tricky. 

In that spirit, I won't be writing about how I made this blog. If you're interested, check out the [source code](https://github.com/ajaxbits/ajaxbits-personal-site).

I will say I'm going for:
- Lots of different types of content (tutorials, TILs, etc.)
- Accessibility
- Simplicity
- More writing, less bikeshedding

I appreciate you being here!
