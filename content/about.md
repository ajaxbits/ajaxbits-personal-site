Hi, my name is Alex, but you can call me `ajax`.

Have fun on my blog! I think I'll write about a ton of different stuff on here, and really try to become my most authentic self.

I'm a young person living in &#10038;&#10038;Chicago&#10038;&#10038;. I was a professional actor for a little bit out of college before diving into computer shit&trade;. 

Trying to make some kind of meaning and mark.
